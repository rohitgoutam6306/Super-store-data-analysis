## Insights

### Unveiling the Big Picture
The store generated a whopping ₹21,176,377 in revenue from 31,047 orders, selling 31,237 units in total.
But who are our biggest customers? Let’s break it down.
### B2B vs B2C
Our sales are heavily dominated by B2C customers (99%), while B2B contributes only 1%.<br/>
This means bulk buyers are our main revenue drivers, and retail consumers make up a very small segment.
### Where Are the Shoppers Coming From?
Online marketplaces are leading the charge!<br/>
Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra contribute 85% of revenue.<br/>
Other 4 channels make up only 15%.<br/>
##### This means our brand presence is strong on major platforms, but there’s potential to improve sales through smaller channels.
### Where Are the Sales Coming From?
Our top 10 states contribute the majority of our revenue, showing strong geographical demand patterns.<br/>
Understanding these locations better can help us fine-tune our marketing strategies.
### Men vs Women
Surprisingly, in B2C sales, women are leading the shopping spree with 64% of total sales, while men account for only 36%.<br/>
##### This insight hints that women’s fashion is a key segment driving sales.
### Age Matters
The 18-49 age group dominates sales, proving that middle-aged and young adults are our core shoppers.<br/>
A surprising twist: Women are shopping more than men! (64% vs. 36%)<br/>
This reinforces the idea that the store should focus on expanding women’s fashion and related categories.
### Most selling Category
Kurta, western dresses, and sets are our top-performing categories.<br/>
On the other side, five other categories are struggling.<br/>
##### This suggests a need to rethink inventory and promotions for underperforming products.
### Does Size Matter? Absolutely!
Sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL, 3XL, and Free Size are flying off the shelves!<br/>
However, 4XL, 5XL, and 6XL aren’t performing well.<br/>
##### This insight is crucial for stock management—less demand for plus sizes means excess inventory risks.
### The 80/20 Rule in Action (Pareto Analysis)
Here’s a game-changing insight: 50% of our SKUs are generating 90% of the revenue, while the remaining 50% contribute just 10%.<br/>
This means half of our products are the real money-makers, and the other half may need reconsideration—either better promotion or discontinuation.
### Delivery Performance Status
92% of orders are successfully delivered – a great sign of operational efficiency.<br/>
However, 3% cancellations, 3% returns, and 2% refunds indicate some friction points that may need attention.
### Revenue by Month jan to dec (2022) – What’s Going On?
Monthly revenue is on a downward trend, from ₹1.9M to ₹1.65M.
## Conclusion
Focus on B2C sales, as they drive nearly all revenue.<br/>
Enhance marketing for women’s fashion, as it’s a high-performing segment.<br/>
Rethink about underperforming categories and sizes to optimize inventory.<br/>
Strengthen sales channels beyond Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra to reduce reliance on a few platforms.<br/>
Prioritize top-performing SKUs and consider phasing out slow-moving products.<br/>
